# GP_for_predicting_J

Here, Pytorch is used to train GP module to help predict magnetic exchange interaction J in amorphous materials. Module is trained on magnetic moments at each site, distance between sites, and magnetic interactions between them.

At the end, it outputs "Mean Absolute Error", and "Predicted" and "True" values of test parameters.
